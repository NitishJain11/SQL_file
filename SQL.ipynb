    "# Q1->What is a database ? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL database?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer->\n",
    "\n",
    "# A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval,\n",
    "# manipulation, and querying of data. Databases are widely used in various applications such as e-commerce, finance, \n",
    "# healthcare, and social media to store and manage large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems with different approaches to organizing and retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a tabular schema to organize data into rows and columns.\n",
    "# SQL databases enforce strict data consistency and integrity rules, which ensure that data is stored and retrieved accurately. \n",
    "# SQL databases use SQL as the query language to retrieve and manipulate data.\n",
    "# SQL databases are widely used in traditional enterprise applications and data warehousing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational approach to data management.\n",
    "# NoSQL databases can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data and are designed to scale horizontally,\n",
    "#       meaning they can add more nodes to the database cluster as needed. \n",
    "# NoSQL databases can be classified into different categories such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. \n",
    "# NoSQL databases use various query languages such as JSON, BSON, and MapReduce to retrieve and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some of the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that must be followed while NoSQL databases have a flexible schema.\n",
    "# Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster while SQL databases typically scale vertically by adding more resources to a single machine.\n",
    "# Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the query language, while NoSQL databases use various query languages such as JSON, BSON, and MapReduce.\n",
    "# Data Consistency: SQL databases enforce strict data consistency and integrity rules while NoSQL databases may sacrifice consistency for better scalability and performance.\n",
    "# In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications with a structured schema and data consistency requirements, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications with\n",
    "# a flexible schema and high scalability requirements."
